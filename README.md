# Cryptography-RSA

This is my third year project at University of East Anglia.

Encripting any messages by RSA encryption.

It uses GUI where you see the messaging box. You can insert any text and it will output an encrypted text 
which you can send to anyone else. Then it can be decryped by the same procedure with RSA. So nobody can read 
your messages.
